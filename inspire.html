    <p>What inspires one to change their lives, or the lives of others? An individual inspires people by creating something valuable that can apply towards other peoples lives.</p>
    <p></p>Covey is a well known businessman, educator, and public speaker. Over the years, Covey has helped many consumers in various ways by writing books relating to self-help. The most inspiring book is called <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.</em> I believe that he inspires me because I have goals to improve myself in many categories and the value that he adds to my life has a profound effect. Since Covey alligns well with my values, his content has helped me to implement different things into my daily life to become healthier, more productive, and more confident.
